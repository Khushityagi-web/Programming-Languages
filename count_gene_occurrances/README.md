# 🧬 Counting Gene Occurrences in R (Beginner Exercise)

This script demonstrates how to count repeated gene names in a vector using R’s built-in table() function.
It is part of a set of foundational programming tasks where I practiced applying basic R operations to simple biological examples.

## 🎯 Purpose

This exercise helps build early R skills, including:

🔹 working with vectors

🔹  using table() to summarize categorical data

🔹  converting tabular output into lists

🔹  printing structured results

Although gene names are used, the goal is to understand how R handles frequency counting, which is essential for many downstream bioinformatics workflows.

##  What the Script Does

🔹 Defines a function count_gene_occurrences()

🔹 Takes a vector of gene names

🔹 Counts how many times each appears

🔹 Returns the results as a list

🔹 Tests the function using an example vector

🔹 Prints the output in a readable format

Example Output:
$GeneA
[1] 2

$GeneB
[1] 3

$GeneC
[1] 1

## 📂 File Structure

## Skills Practiced

🔹 Frequency counting with table()

🔹 Converting data structures (table → list)

🔹 Writing simple functions in R

🔹 Basic vector manipulation

🔹 Applying biological labels to foundational logic

## Requirements

R 3.6+
(No external packages required)
