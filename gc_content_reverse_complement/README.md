#  GC Content & Reverse Complement in Python (Beginner Exercise)

This script computes the GC content of a DNA sequence and generates its reverse complement.
It is part of my foundational Python exercises, where I practiced applying basic string operations and dictionaries to biologically meaningful tasks.

These are essential concepts in genomics and form the building blocks for more advanced FASTA parsing and sequence analysis later.

## 🎯 Purpose

To practice:

🔹 Writing modular Python functions

🔹 Counting nucleotides and computing percentages

🔹 Reversing strings using slicing

🔹 Using dictionaries to map nucleotide complements

🔹 Handling user input and printing clean results

## What the Script Does

1. GC Content Calculation

Counts the number of G and C bases and returns GC percentage.

2. Reverse Complement

Reverses the DNA sequence

Maps each base to its complement using a dictionary

Joins the result into a final string

Example:

Input:
AATCGGGACTTCAT

Output:

GC Content: 42.86%
Reverse Complement: ATGAAGTCCCGATT

## 📂 File Structure
gc_content_reverse_complement/
│── script.py     # GC content + reverse complement functions
└── README.md

## Skills Practiced

🔹 Python function design

🔹 String reversal and indexing

🔹 Dictionary-based base pairing

🔹 Simple biological sequence manipulation

🔹 Console interaction with user-defined input

## Requirements

Python 3.x
(No external libraries required)
