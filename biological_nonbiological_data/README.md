# 📘 Python Basics: Representing Biological & Non-Biological Data

This folder contains a beginner-friendly Python script demonstrating how different data types are used to represent biological and environmental information.
It is part of my early programming exercises while building foundational skills for bioinformatics.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this script is to practice:

🔹 Python primitive data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)

🔹 Python collections (lists, dictionaries)

🔹 Printing and formatting structured output

🔹 Representing biological entities (genes, proteins) with basic Python objects

🧬 What the Script Demonstrates
🔹 Biological Data Examples

🔹 Protein name (string)

🔹 Gene ID (integer)

🔹 Protein molecular weight (float)

🔹 Activity status (boolean)

🔹 List of amino acids (list)

🔹 Non-Biological / Environmental Data

🔹 Air quality index (integer)

🔹 Average rainfall (float)

🔹 City name (string)

🔹 Rainfall status (boolean)

🔹 Temperature records (dictionary)

The script prints both categories to show how Python handles different data types.

## 📂 File Structure
biological_nonbiological_data/
│── script.py   # Demonstrates Python data types with biological examples
└── README.md

## Skills Practiced

🔹 Python variable creation

🔹 Use of primitive and collection data types

🔹 Basic formatting with f-strings

🔹 Translating real-world concepts into programmatic structures

##  Requirements

🔹 Python 3.x

🔹 No external libraries are needed.
