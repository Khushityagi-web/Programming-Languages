# Python Basics: Representing Biological & Non-Biological Data

This folder contains a beginner-friendly Python script demonstrating how different data types are used to represent biological and environmental information. It is part of my early programming exercises while building foundational skills for bioinformatics.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this script is to practice:

- Python primitive data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)  
- Python collections (lists, dictionaries)  
- Printing and formatting structured output  
- Representing biological entities (genes, proteins) with basic Python objects  

---

## What the Script Demonstrates

### Biological Data Examples

- Protein name (string)  
- Gene ID (integer)  
- Protein molecular weight (float)  
- Activity status (boolean)  
- List of amino acids (list)  

### Non-Biological / Environmental Data

- Air quality index (integer)  
- Average rainfall (float)  
- City name (string)  
- Rainfall status (boolean)  
- Temperature records (dictionary)  

The script prints both categories to illustrate how Python handles different data types in a structured and readable way.

## Skills Practiced

- Python variable creation  
- Use of primitive and collection data types  
- Basic formatting with f-strings  
- Translating real-world concepts into programmatic structures
