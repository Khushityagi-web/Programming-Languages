# Counting Gene Occurrences in Python (Beginner Exercise)

This folder contains a Python script that counts how many times each gene name appears in a list. It is a foundational programming exercise designed to practice loops, conditionals, and dictionary operations using biological examples.

---

## Purpose

This exercise was created to strengthen:

- Python dictionary manipulation  
- Looping through lists  
- Basic conditional logic  
- Returning structured results  
- Representing biological categories computationally  

Although gene names are used, the goal is to understand how Python handles frequency counting—a concept that later appears in FASTA parsing, metadata quality control, and feature summarization.

---

## What the Script Does

- Defines a function `count_gene_occurrences()`  
- Iterates through a list of gene names  
- Tracks counts using a dictionary  
- Returns gene → count pairs  
- Tests the function with a sample list  
- Prints the resulting dictionary  

### Example Output

    {'GeneA': 2, 'GeneB': 3, 'GeneC': 1}
