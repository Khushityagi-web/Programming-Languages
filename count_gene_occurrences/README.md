# 🧬 Counting Gene Occurrences in Python (Beginner Exercise)

This folder contains a Python script that counts how many times each gene name appears in a list.
It is a foundational programming exercise designed to practice loops, conditionals, and dictionary operations using biological examples.

## 🎯 Purpose

This exercise was created to strengthen:

🔹 Python dictionary manipulation

🔹 Looping through lists

🔹 Basic conditional logic

🔹 Returning structured results

🔹 Representing biological categories computationally

Although gene names are used, the goal is to understand how Python handles frequency counting, a concept that later appears in parsing FASTA files, metadata QC, and feature summarization.

## What the Script Does

🔹 Defines a function count_gene_occurrences()

🔹 Iterates through a list of gene names

🔹 Tracks counts using a dictionary

🔹 Returns gene → count pairs

🔹 Tests the function with a sample list

🔹 Prints the resulting dictionary

Example Output:
{'GeneA': 2, 'GeneB': 3, 'GeneC': 1}

## 📂 File Structure
count_gene_occurrences/
│── script.py   # Python function to count occurrences of gene names
└── README.md

## Skills Practiced

🔹 Writing basic Python functions

🔹 Using dictionaries for frequency counting

🔹 Looping and conditional updates

🔹 Translating biological examples into simple code logic

## Requirements

Python 3.x
(No external libraries required)
