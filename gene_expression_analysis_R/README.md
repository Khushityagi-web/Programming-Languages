# Gene Expression Loop Exercises in R (Beginner Practice)

This script contains two introductory R exercises that use gene expression values to practice looping concepts (for and while).
Although the examples use biological numbers, the aim is to build essential programming skills needed for later bioinformatics work.

## 🎯 Purpose

To learn and practice:

🔹 Writing for loops in R

🔹 Writing while loops in R

🔹 Summation and averaging

🔹 Conditional checks (if)

🔹 Index-based iteration

🔹 Printing formatted output with cat()

## What the Script Does

1. Average Gene Expression Using a For Loop

Iterates through a numeric vector

Computes the total expression

Calculates the average

Prints the result

Output:
The average gene expression value is: 2500

2. Counting Expression Values Above a Threshold Using a While Loop

Iterates through values using an index counter

Checks whether each value exceeds a threshold

Counts the number of qualifying values

Output:
The number of genes with expression values above 10 is: 2
