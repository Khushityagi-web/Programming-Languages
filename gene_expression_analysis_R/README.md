# Gene Expression Loop Exercises in R (Beginner Practice)

This script contains two introductory R exercises that use gene expression values to practice looping concepts (`for` and `while`). Although the examples use biological numbers, the aim is to build essential programming skills needed for later bioinformatics work.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this exercise is to learn and practice:

- Writing `for` loops in R  
- Writing `while` loops in R  
- Summation and averaging  
- Conditional checks (`if`)  
- Index-based iteration  
- Printing formatted output using `cat()`

## What the Script Does

### Average Gene Expression Using a For Loop

- Iterates through a numeric vector  
- Computes the total expression  
- Calculates the average  
- Prints the result  

**Example output:**

    The average gene expression value is: 2500

---

### Counting Expression Values Above a Threshold Using a While Loop

- Iterates through values using an index counter  
- Checks whether each value exceeds a threshold  
- Counts the number of qualifying values  

**Example output:**

    The number of genes with expression values above 10 is: 2
