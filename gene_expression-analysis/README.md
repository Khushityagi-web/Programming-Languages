# Gene Expression Loop Exercises in Python (Beginner Practice)

This script contains two introductory Python exercises that use gene expression values to practice looping techniques (for and while).
Although the examples use biological numbers, the primary goal is to build strong foundational programming skills for future bioinformatics workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

To strengthen:

🔹 Python for loops

🔹 Python while loops

🔹 Basic arithmetic (sum, average)

🔹 Conditional logic

🔹 Iterating through lists

Using biological intuition to make practice more meaningful

## What the Script Demonstrates

1. Average Gene Expression Using a For Loop

Iterates through a list of gene expression values

Computes the total

Calculates the average

Prints the final result

Output example:
The average gene expression value is: 2500.0

2. Counting Genes Above a Threshold Using a While Loop

Loops through expression values using index-based iteration

Checks each value against a threshold

Counts how many exceed the threshold

Output example:
The number of genes with expression values above 10 is: 2

## Skills Practiced

🔹 Looping with for and while

🔹 Index-based iteration

🔹 Conditional checks (if)

🔹 Summation and averaging

🔹 Simple decision-making based on thresholds

🔹 Applying Python basics to biological-style numeric data
