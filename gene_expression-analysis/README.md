# Gene Expression Loop Exercises in Python (Beginner Practice)

This script contains two introductory Python exercises that use gene expression values to practice looping techniques (`for` and `while`). Although the examples use biological numbers, the primary goal is to build strong foundational programming skills for future bioinformatics workflows.

---

## Purpose

This exercise is designed to strengthen:

- Python `for` loops  
- Python `while` loops  
- Basic arithmetic (sum and average)  
- Conditional logic  
- Iterating through lists  

Biological intuition is used to make the practice more meaningful.

## What the Script Demonstrates

### Average Gene Expression Using a For Loop

- Iterates through a list of gene expression values  
- Computes the total  
- Calculates the average  
- Prints the final result  

**Example output:**

    The average gene expression value is: 2500.0

---

### Counting Genes Above a Threshold Using a While Loop

- Loops through expression values using index-based iteration  
- Checks each value against a threshold  
- Counts how many exceed the threshold  

**Example output:**

    The number of genes with expression values above 10 is: 2
