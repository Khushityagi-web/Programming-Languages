# Gene Expression Classification in R (Beginner Exercise)

This script demonstrates a simple R function that classifies gene expression values into categories such as **High**, **Moderate**, **Low**, and **Undetected**. It is part of my foundational programming exercises while learning to apply R logic to biological contexts.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this exercise is to practice:

- Writing user-defined functions in R  
- Using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)  
- Iterating through vectors  
- Printing structured output using `cat()`  

The biological theme (gene expression thresholds) is used purely as an intuitive example to make the exercise more meaningful.

## What the Script Does

- Defines a function `check_gene_expression()` that assigns categories based on numeric thresholds  
- Applies this function to a vector of example expression values  
- Prints the assigned category for each value  

### Thresholds Used

| Expression Value | Category     |
|------------------|--------------|
| ≥ 1000           | High         |
| ≥ 500            | Moderate     |
| ≥ 100            | Low          |
| < 100            | Undetected  |
