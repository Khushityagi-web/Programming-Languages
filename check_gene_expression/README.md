# 🧬 Gene Expression Classification in R (Beginner Exercise)

This script demonstrates a simple R function that classifies gene expression values into categories such as High, Moderate, Low, and Undetected.
It is part of my foundational programming exercises while learning to apply R logic to biological contexts.

## 🎯 Purpose

To practice:

🔹 Writing user-defined functions in R

🔹 Using conditional statements (if, else if, else)

🔹 Iterating through vectors

🔹 Printing structured output with cat()

The biological theme (gene expression thresholds) is used purely as an intuitive example to make the exercise more meaningful.

## 🧬 What the Script Does

🔹 Defines a function check_gene_expression() that assigns categories based on numeric thresholds

🔹 Applies this function to a vector of example expression values

🔹 Prints out the assigned category for each value

Thresholds Used:
🔹 Expression Value	Category
🔹 ≥ 1000	High
🔹 ≥ 500	Moderate
🔹 ≥ 100	Low
🔹 < 100	Undetected

## 📂 File Structure
check_gene_expression/
│── script.R      # R script implementing the classification function
└── README.md

## Skills Practiced

🔹 R function creation

🔹 Conditional logic

🔹 Looping with for

🔹 Basic output formatting

🔹 Translating biological concepts into simple computational rules

##  Requirements

🔹 R 3.6+
(No additional packages required)
