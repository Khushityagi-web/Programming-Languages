# Programming Foundations for Bioinformatics

This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Python and R scripts created during my early journey into computational biology.
Each script represents a small, focused exercise designed to build foundational programming concepts using biologically intuitive examples.

Rather than hiding early work, this repository documents the starting point of my transition into bioinformatics programming —
from handling basic data types and loops to simple DNA sequence operations such as GC content and reverse complement.

These scripts form the groundwork that later enabled me to work confidently with real biological datasets, write reproducible workflows, and build more complex analyses.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The aim of this repo is to:

🔹 strengthen foundational Python and R programming concepts

🔹 practice applying computational thinking to biological examples

🔹 develop logic patterns useful in downstream bioinformatics workflows

🔹 track early skill progression clearly and transparently

🔹 maintain an organized archive of beginner exercises for future reference

This is not a bioinformatics analysis repository.
Instead, it captures the essential early steps that shaped my programming intuition.

## Concepts Practiced Across Scripts

These exercises collectively strengthen the following programming fundamentals:

🔹 Python Skills

🔹 variables, data types, lists, dictionaries

🔹 writing functions

🔹 looping (for, while)

🔹 conditional branching

string manipulation

🔹 biological string operations (GC%, reverse complement)

🔹 R Skills

🔹 vectors and indexing

🔹 for-loops and while-loops

🔹 conditional statements

🔹 using table() for frequency counting

🔹 simple function definitions

🔹 Bioinformatics-Relevant Intuition

🔹 representing genes, proteins, and sequences programmatically

🔹 applying threshold rules to biological data

🔹 understanding categorical counts

🔹 mapping biological concepts to computational logic

🔹 These skills later scale naturally into tasks like:

FASTA parsing

metadata QC

gene count summarization

exploratory transcriptomic workflows

data-driven conditional filtering

## Why Biological Examples?

Biological contexts such as:

🔹 gene expression thresholds

🔹 nucleotide complements

🔹 GC percentage

🔹 amino acid lists

…help bridge the gap between pure programming and real bioinformatics problem-solving.

Using biology to learn programming made the concepts feel more intuitive and relevant to future work in computational genomics.

## Requirements

🔹 Python 3.x

🔹 R 3.6+

No external libraries required.

## How This Repository Fits Into My Journey

This repo is part of my GitHub Revamp Series, where I revisit old code, reorganize it, and document what each piece taught me.

These scripts show:

where the basics began,

how the thought process evolved,

and how small, consistent practice built the foundation for more advanced tools and workflows later.

They are not polished research pipelines —
they are the building blocks that made those pipelines possible.
