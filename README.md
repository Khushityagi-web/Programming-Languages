# Programming Foundations for Bioinformatics

This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Python and R scripts created during my early journey into computational biology. Each script represents a small, focused exercise designed to build foundational programming concepts using biologically intuitive examples.

Rather than hiding early work, this repository documents the starting point of my transition into bioinformatics programming — from handling basic data types and loops to simple DNA sequence operations such as GC content and reverse complement.

These scripts form the groundwork that later enabled me to work confidently with real biological datasets, write reproducible workflows, and build more complex analyses.

## Purpose of This Repository

The aim of this repository is to:

- Strengthen foundational Python and R programming concepts  
- Practice applying computational thinking to biological examples  
- Develop logic patterns useful in downstream bioinformatics workflows  
- Track early skill progression clearly and transparently  
- Maintain an organized archive of beginner exercises for future reference  

This is not a bioinformatics analysis repository. Instead, it captures the essential early steps that shaped my programming intuition.

## Concepts Practiced Across Scripts

These exercises collectively strengthen the following programming fundamentals.

### Python Skills
- Variables, data types, lists, and dictionaries  
- Writing functions  
- Looping (`for`, `while`)  
- Conditional branching  
- String manipulation  
- Biological string operations (GC percentage, reverse complement)  

### R Skills
- Vectors and indexing  
- `for` loops and `while` loops  
- Conditional statements  
- Using `table()` for frequency counting  
- Simple function definitions  

### Bioinformatics-Relevant Intuition
- Representing genes, proteins, and sequences programmatically  
- Applying threshold-based rules to biological data  
- Understanding categorical counts  
- Mapping biological concepts to computational logic  

These skills later scale naturally into tasks such as:

- FASTA parsing  
- Metadata quality control  
- Gene count summarization  
- Exploratory transcriptomic workflows  
- Data-driven conditional filtering

## Why Biological Examples?

Biological contexts such as:

- Gene expression thresholds  
- Nucleotide complements  
- GC percentage  
- Amino acid lists  

Help bridge the gap between pure programming and real bioinformatics problem-solving.

Using biology to learn programming made the concepts feel more intuitive and directly relevant to future work in computational genomics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- R 3.6+  

No external libraries are required.

## How This Repository Fits Into My Journey

This repository is part of my **GitHub Revamp Series**, where I revisit old code, reorganize it, and document what each piece taught me.

These scripts show:

- Where the basics began  
- How the thought process evolved  
- How small, consistent practice built the foundation for more advanced tools and workflows later  

They are not polished research pipelines — they are the building blocks that made those pipelines possible.
