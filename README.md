# Programming Assignments for Bioinformatics Upskilling
# Overview
This repository contains programming assignments I have completed as part of my journey to upskill myself in bioinformatics. These assignments cover fundamental concepts in Python and R, focusing on data analysis, biological data processing, and computational techniques relevant to the field.

# Why This Repository?
As I advance in bioinformatics, I aim to strengthen my programming skills by solving real-world problems related to:

Gene expression analysis
Sequence analysis
Data visualization
Statistical computations
Machine learning for biological data
By working on these assignments, I am improving my proficiency in:
Python – for data analysis, automation, and bioinformatics pipelines
R – for statistical computing and biological data visualization

Assignments Covered
Python Scripts
Gene Expression Classification – Classifying gene expression levels based on predefined thresholds.
Loops in Python – Computing average gene expression using for and while loops.
GC Content Calculation – Function to compute GC content in a DNA sequence.
Counting Gene Occurrences – Using dictionaries to count occurrences of gene names.
R Scripts
Gene Expression Analysis – Implementing classification logic using conditional statements.
Loops in R – Using for and while loops for gene expression analysis.
Gene Occurrences with Table() – Counting occurrences of genes in a dataset.
