# 🧬 GC Content Calculator in Python (Beginner Exercise)

This repository contains a simple Python function that calculates the GC content of a DNA sequence.
It is part of my early programming exercises where I practiced writing reusable functions for biological string processing.

GC content is a basic but important metric in genomics, representing the percentage of nucleotides in a DNA molecule that are either G (guanine) or C (cytosine).

## 🎯 Purpose

This exercise was designed to strengthen:

🔹 Python function creation

🔹 String handling and counting operations

🔹 Basic computation and percentage calculation

🔹 Printing formatted biological results

## 🧬 What the Script Does

🔹 Defines a function compute_gc_content()

🔹 Counts the number of 'G' and 'C' bases

🔹 Computes GC percentage

🔹 Returns the result as a float

🔹 Tests the function on a sample DNA sequence

🔹 Prints the GC content with two decimal places

Example:

Input sequence: ATGCGTACG
Output: GC Content: 55.56%

## 📂 File Structure
compute_gc_content/
│── script.py      # Python function to compute GC percentage
└── README.md

##  Skills Practiced

🔹 Writing modular functions in Python

🔹 Understanding string methods (.count())

🔹 Performing arithmetic and percentage calculations

🔹 Using f-strings for clean output formatting

🔹 Representing biological concepts computationally

##  Requirements

Python 3.x
(No external packages required)
