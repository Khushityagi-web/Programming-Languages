# GC Content Calculator in Python (Beginner Exercise)

This repository contains a simple Python function that calculates the GC content of a DNA sequence. It is part of my early programming exercises where I practiced writing reusable functions for biological string processing.

GC content is a basic but important metric in genomics, representing the percentage of nucleotides in a DNA molecule that are either G (guanine) or C (cytosine).

## Purpose

This exercise was designed to strengthen:

- Python function creation  
- String handling and counting operations  
- Basic computation and percentage calculation  
- Printing formatted biological results  

---

## What the Script Does

- Defines a function `compute_gc_content()`  
- Counts the number of `G` and `C` bases  
- Computes GC percentage  
- Returns the result as a float  
- Tests the function on a sample DNA sequence  
- Prints the GC content formatted to two decimal places  

### Example

    Input sequence: ATGCGTACG
    Output: GC Content: 55.56%
